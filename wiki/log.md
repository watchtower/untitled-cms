## [2026-09-13] fix | Page save, editor sync and Vault size label
- Found during browser smoke tests of the upgrade; all three predate it.
- `PageController` store/update: empty editor content arrives as `null` (ConvertEmptyStringsToNull) and crashed `clean()`.
  Store now cleans `content ?? ''`. Update only cleans `content` when it was submitted, so partial updates keep existing content.
- `Components/Editor.tsx`: the TinyMCE textarea id was regenerated on every render, so each render re-initialised the editor
  and leaked instances (500+ seen). The id is now a stable `useRef`, and cleanup removes the editor instance by id.
  Content syncs on `input change undo redo` (not `SetContent`, which would mark forms dirty on load).
- `VaultController::adminPage` sends `maxUploadSize` in MB (the dialog's unit): the smallest of `upload_max_filesize`,
  `post_max_size` and `vault.max_upload_kb`, ignoring 0/-1 ini values.
- New tests: empty-content create/update and omitted-content update in `PageControllerTest`, and the Vault MB prop in `VaultUploadTest`.

## [2026-09-13] update | Dependency upgrades completed
- Executed all 7 phases of `docs/dependency-upgrade-plan.md` (see its Outcome section). Final gate is green:
  93 tests on PHPUnit 13, `tsc` and Vite 8 build clean, both audits clean.
- New conventions: admin tables use TanStack v9 `useTable` with the shared `dataTableFeatures` and `DataTableColumnDef<T>`
  from `Components/Common/DataTable.tsx`. Inertia shared props are typed via `InertiaConfig.sharedPageProps` in `types/global.d.ts`.
  `OptimizeVaultImageJob` uses Laravel's `Image` facade.
- `package.json` carries an `overrides` pin for `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` (`^7.29.0`) so Vite 8's React plugin
  installs next to the shadcn CLI. Node requirement is now 22.12+.
- Updated [architecture/stack](architecture/stack.md), [frontend/ui-stack](frontend/ui-stack.md) and
  [modules/vault](modules/vault.md). The Vault page's "Intervention Image" claim for `SanitizeImage` was wrong (it uses GD) and is corrected.

## [2026-09-13] ingest | Dependency upgrade plan
- Added `docs/dependency-upgrade-plan.md`: 7 staged phases. (1) npm audit + in-range updates, (2) `laravel/ai` 0.11,
  (3) Intervention 4 via `Illuminate\Image`, (4) Vite 8 toolchain, (5) Inertia v3, (6) PHPUnit 13, (7) TanStack Table 9, lucide 1.x, react-dropzone 20, and other npm majors.
- Framework already at latest (v13.31.0). Baseline: 91 tests green, zero PHPUnit 12.5 deprecations, `tsc` clean.
- Blocked: Guzzle 8 (`league/oauth1-client` 1.11 caps at `^7`). Deferred: TypeScript 7 (no compiler API; `types: []` default).
- Found: Laravel 13's `Illuminate\Image` drivers require Intervention `^4`. `OptimizeVaultImageJob` will move onto the `Image` facade.
- Wiki pages to update as phases land: architecture/stack, frontend/ui-stack (Vite 7 mentions), modules/vault, modules/ai-hub, architecture/testing.

## [2026-09-13] release | 0.5.1
- Security patch after 0.5.0's CI Security Audit failed (`composer audit --no-dev` exits 1 on any advisory).
- Updated `laravel/framework`, `league/commonmark`, `guzzlehttp/guzzle`, `guzzlehttp/psr7`, `phpseclib/phpseclib`,
  `mongodb/mongodb` (2.4.2), `mongodb/laravel-mongodb` (5.11.0).
- **New platform requirement:** `mongodb/mongodb` 2.4 needs `ext-mongodb ^2.4`, now declared in `composer.json`.
  CI (`setup-php`) and the Dockerfiles install the latest extension unpinned, so they're unaffected; local and
  self-hosted installs must upgrade the extension. On Homebrew PHP, `pecl upgrade` fails if `php.ini` already
  loads `mongodb.so` — comment the line out, `pecl install -f mongodb`, and pecl re-adds it.
- README/`docs/deployment.md` requirement rows now say `mongodb` (2.4+).

## [2026-09-13] release | 0.5.0
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` bumped to 0.5.0. `composer.json` intentionally carries no `version` (Packagist reads tags).
- CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` promoted to `[0.5.0] — 2026-09-13`; README "What's New" section and current version updated.
- CHANGELOG compare links fixed: tags are un-prefixed (`0.4.0`), so the old `v0.x.0` links returned 404.
- Release ships migration `2026_09_13_093743_add_unique_index_to_vault_folders` — upgraders must run `php artisan migrate`.

## [2026-09-13] update | README and CHANGELOG synced with changes since 0.4.0
- README gained a "What's New Since 0.4.0" section; CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` populated from the 14 commits since the tag.
- README claims corrected against code: pipeline is 6 stages + optional `SandboxedScan` (inserted after `ValidateMimeType`);
  no scheduled publishing (moved to Planned); Menus use nested items with up/down ordering and Banners use an `order`
  field (the data-table drag handle does not persist); Node >= 20 / npm >= 10; `mongodb/laravel-mongodb ^5.7`;
  `ezyang/htmlpurifier` replaces `mews/purifier`; Recharts `^3`; added Resend, AI Assistant, Email, TinyMCE, Windows installer.
- `overview.md` permission count corrected to 31. `AGENTS.md` social login corrected to Google + GitHub only.
- Open issue: `install.sh` / `install.ps1` still accept PHP >= 8.2 while `composer.json` requires `^8.4`.

## [2026-09-13] refactor | Consolidated agent config into AGENTS.md
- `AGENTS.md` is now the single source of truth for all agents; it absorbed CLAUDE.md's architecture,
  services, permissions, middleware, Inertia props, frontend, routes, and database sections.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are stubs that import `@AGENTS.md`; the three duplicated wiki-protocol blocks were merged.
- Conflicts resolved: wiki-update triggers unioned; log step now points to the SCHEMA.md entry format;
  tests live in both `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit`.
- Drift fixed against code: policy count (was "8", now 10 — count removed), permission count (was "~32", 31 — count removed),
  unverifiable local Mongo port 27018 dropped (CI and `.env.example` use 27017), added `admin` middleware alias,
  conditional `SandboxedScan` pipe, `HtmlSanitizer` + `EmailWebhooks/` services, `/media` and user-batch throttles,
  `auth.user` field subset, and the 300s `active_menus` cache.
- `SCHEMA.md` convention now says "don't duplicate AGENTS.md" instead of CLAUDE.md.

## [2026-09-13] update | Impact review fixes: menus, vault policies, folder index
- `MenuController` item rules now match the real `{id, title, url, target, order, subItems}` shape.
  Rules for `label`/`children` rejected every save and, with `excludeUnvalidatedArrayKeys`, stripped item data.
- `VaultFolderPolicy::create` requires `media.create` even with a parent. New `forceDelete` requires `media.delete`.
- `saveAiImage` authorizes the target folder. Folder restore checks for name collisions.
- Unique folder index migration guards against "already exists" and duplicate-key errors. Folder writes map a lost race (11000) to a 422.
- `folders.list?all=1` returns the full tree (nested folders were invisible). `useVaultBrowser` debounces search,
  drops stale responses, resets alt text on selection, and batch-restores via one request.
- Batch `uuids` are capped at 500. `saveAiImage` always removes its temp file.
- Corrected the long-standing "tests use SQLite in-memory" claim. Only the default connection is SQLite; models pin `mongodb`,
  so tests need the MongoDB server from `.env` (the local Docker container on 27018).
- Updated [modules/permissions](modules/permissions.md), [modules/vault](modules/vault.md),
  [database/collections](database/collections.md), [architecture/testing](architecture/testing.md), and [frontend/ui-stack](frontend/ui-stack.md).

## [2026-09-05] ingest | Search discoverability baseline (Day 0)
Digested `docs/seo-discoverability-plan.md` and executed Step 1. Created
[discoverability](discoverability.md) with the Day-0 baseline: 0 stars, no topics, empty homepageUrl,
no Packagist package, Pages not enabled, and **0 Google-indexed pages** for the repo
(verified in a real browser, not a search API).
Key correction to the plan: the repo page is unindexed but the project *is* surfacing
through proxies — trendshift.io, the `watchtower` org page and the `NavanithanS` user
page all rank for `"Untitled CMS"` carrying the repo description.
Plan §3 superseded: competing `Untitled CMS` projects now exist (`tar6/Untitled-CMS`,
hirammendiola.com). New finding: the `watchtower` org name collides with
`containrrr/watchtower`.
Plan §7 both flagship keywords dropped after validation (`laravel mongodb cms` is a
driver-docs query; `ai native cms` is now vendor-owned). Surviving surface is the
llms.txt / Markdown-for-agents angle.
Staged: README lead paragraph moved above the badge block; `composer.json` gained
`homepage`/`support`, lost its hardcoded `version` (repo has git tags).

## [2026-07-15] update | Impact sentinel + code review hardening follow-ups
- emptyTrash: per-file `forceDelete` only; avoid Mongo `chunk()` SortDirection bug.
- Batch vault FormRequests use `Rule::exists(Model::class)`; batch actions require `viewAny`.
- save AI image uses named route `admin.vault.save-ai-image`; SaveAiImage policy create.
- VaultFolderController uses `$this->authorize`; upload uses folder-scoped create.
- useVaultBrowser: no double-fetch on trash/root; shift-select sets lastSelectedFile.
- 87 PHPUnit tests green; npm build green.

## [2026-07-14] update | Hardening epic complete
- Implemented `AiHttpClient`; `AiService` no longer uses raw `Http::`.
- Policy-first Vault + public draft preview (`viewAny` on Page).
- Vault FormRequests; Banner/Menu unique rules use `Rule::unique(Model::class)`.
- Vault FE: `useVaultBrowser`, `VaultDialogs`, `VaultFolderInfoPopover`.
- Tests: PublicPageMarkdown, Menu, Banner, AiChat, AiHttpClient unit; suite green.
- Plan marked complete: `docs/hardening-entropy-implementation-plan.md`.

## [2026-07-12] update | Hardening epic: docs truth, Mongo ADR, HTTP tiers, policy-first
- Aligned README/wiki with code: PHP 8.4+, TinyMCE, 32 permissions, multi-provider AI, Vault pipeline wording.
- Added [architecture/mongodb](architecture/mongodb.md) decision page; linked from index + stack.
- Documented two-tier outbound HTTP (`SafeHttpClient` vs `AiHttpClient`) in services + ai-hub.
- Documented policy-first controller convention in permissions.
- Added SCHEMA “Source of truth” anti-drift table.
- Implementation plan: `docs/hardening-entropy-implementation-plan.md`.

## [2026-06-28] update | AI Chat Resilience & Shadcn Primitives
- Documented adoption of shadcn/ui chat primitives in `frontend/ui-stack.md`.
- Updated `modules/ai-hub.md` to reflect proper context usage of chat sessions.
- Documented AI chat rate limits and HTTP 429 2-second retry logic in `modules/ai-hub.md`.

## [2026-06-13] update | SCHEMA.md Release Operation
Added the `Release` operation to `SCHEMA.md` to ensure `CHANGELOG.md` is updated on every new release.

## [2026-06-13] update | Security Sweep & Vault Performance Fixes
Completed a comprehensive security audit using Sentinel and Code Reviewer standards:
- **SSRF / DNS Rebinding**: Hardened `SafeHttpClient` using `CURLOPT_RESOLVE` to pin IP addresses and prevent DNS rebinding attacks on outbound requests.
- **XSS Protection**: Installed `rehype-sanitize` in `AiChatSidebar.tsx` to safely render AI-generated markdown, neutralizing Stored XSS vectors.
- **Authorization**: Fixed a bypass in `AiActionController` by dynamically authorizing resolved models for updates. 
- **Policy Refactor**: Resolved dummy-model anti-patterns in `UserPolicy` by introducing dedicated `batchUpdate` and `batchDelete` gate methods.
- **Performance**: Fixed a severe O(N²) exponential recursion query bug in `VaultService::purgeFolder` by strictly looking up descendants via `parent_id` rather than wildcard `path_slug` matching.

## [2026-06-08] feat | Upgrade integrations for Laravel 13.8/13.14 features
- Applied Laravel 13.8.0 `shouldRenderJsonWhen` exception feature in `bootstrap/app.php` with custom API route bypassing.
- Integrated Apple `passwordrules` autocomplete hints via Inertia shared props into React Auth/User forms.
- Migrated `ProcessEmailWebhook` to the new `Interruptible` contract for clean daemon teardowns.
## [2026-05-23] fix | Setting::get() cache serialization
Impact Sentinel detected `Setting::get()` caching full Eloquent model objects, which broke under
the new `serializable_classes => false` config (incomplete object warnings on every request).
Refactored to cache the coerced scalar value instead of the model instance. Flushed stale cache.
Also bumped `laravel/framework` from v13.4.0 → v13.11.2 (latest). 56 tests pass, zero warnings.

## [2026-05-23] update | Sync with laravel/laravel v13.7.0 Skeleton
Applied skeleton changes from v13.0.0→v13.7.0:
- Added `laravel/pao ^1.0.6` (PHP Agent-Optimized Output) — auto-formats PHPUnit/Artisan output as compact JSON when running inside AI agents.
- Created `.npmrc` with `ignore-scripts=true` and `audit=true` (v13.1.2 security hardening against malicious postinstall scripts).
- Updated `.gitignore`: removed `/.fleet`, added `/.codex`, `/.cursor/`, `/public/fonts-manifest.dev.json`, `_ide_helper.php`.
- Updated `.editorconfig`: compose file glob now covers `docker-compose.{yml,yaml}` naming variants.
- Deferred: `@no_additional_args` in composer test script (requires Composer ≥2.8; we're on 2.7.6).
- Deferred: Vite font plugin migration (v13.5.0) — we use `@fontsource-variable/*` packages instead.

## [2026-05-23] update | Laravel 13 Upgrade Hardening
Verified Laravel 13.4.0 framework compatibility and applied recommended upgrade changes:
- Bumped `phpunit/phpunit` from `^11.5.3` to `^12.0` (locked at 12.5.26). All 56 tests pass.
- Added `serializable_classes => false` to `config/cache.php` for deserialization attack hardening.
- Verified no `new static()` in model boot methods, no `Str::createUuidsUsing` in tests.
- Cache prefix already uses L13 hyphenated format. `PreventRequestForgery` middleware is active via framework defaults.
- `nunomaduro/collision ^8.6` remains compatible. `laravel/ai ^0.5` (v0.5.1) still pre-release.

## [2026-05-23] update | Shadcn Preset & React 19
Updated UI stack documentation and dependencies:
- Upgraded React to v19 in package.json and reflected the change in CLAUDE.md, wiki/architecture/stack.md, and wiki/frontend/ui-stack.md.
- Initialized Shadcn with the custom b2fA preset and unified radix imports.
- Created a baseline restore point for the Tailwind v4 + React 19 + b2fA UI state.

## [2026-05-23] update | Tailwind v4 & Shadcn Preset Migration
Migrated the front-end style stack from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4 and updated the shadcn setup:
- Run `@tailwindcss/upgrade` to move dependency packages and translate stylesheet settings to native CSS `@theme`.
- Unified 20 individual `@radix-ui/react-*` dependencies under a single `radix-ui` library.
- Updated `components.json` and regenerated/overwrote all 36 components under `resources/js/Components/ui/` with modern v4 registry code.
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `resizable.tsx` and `UploadPipelineTracker.tsx`.
- Updated [frontend/ui-stack](frontend/ui-stack.md) with the new stack information.

## [2026-05-23] update | Media Vault Security Gates & Scaling
Improved security, query performance, and scaling across the Media Vault:
- Added sibling unique name checks on folder create, rename, and move to prevent path/slug collisions.
- Added destination folder authorization checks to prevent folder move privilege bypasses.
- Added strict fail-closed toggle options on ClamAV scanner timeouts or daemon connectivity outages.
- Eager-loaded the folder relationship in file listings to resolve N+1 database queries.
- Optimised the Artisan purge command via chunking to maintain a low and constant memory footprint.
- Added client memory protection in upload dialog, bypassing pre-upload hashing on files larger than 10MB.
- Updated [modules/vault](modules/vault.md) to document the dynamic scanning stages and fail-closed options.

## [2026-04-13] feat | Media Vault Hardening & Optimizations
Implemented [docs/vault-improvements-plan.md](../docs/vault-improvements-plan.md).
- Phase 1: Cascade slugs and physical relocation for folder rename/move in `VaultService`.
- Phase 2: Added `PruneVaultSandbox` job and `vault:purge` Artisan command.
- Phase 3: Added CDN-friendly `/media/{uuid}` route and RFC 7232 headers for caching.
- Phase 4: Added batch-restore, empty-trash, and folder force-delete endpoints.
- Phase 5: Implemented client-side SHA-256 duplicate detection with `VaultUploadDialog` warnings.
- Phase 6: Created `useVaultPicker` React hook for global media selection.


## [2026-04-12] feat | OpenRouter & AI Hub Security Refactor
Integrated OpenRouter as a supported AI provider for text generation and vision. 
Implemented `clear_key` explicit API key revocation UI within the AI Hub dashboard.
Optimized `AiContextService` to prevent unconditional database context loading out of scope.

## [2026-04-06] refactor | Multi-provider Email Abstraction
Abstracted all email provider logic into [Services/EmailWebhooks/Contracts/WebhookProvider](Services/EmailWebhooks/Contracts/WebhookProvider.md).
Created Support for Resend (Svix), Mailgun (HMAC), and SendGrid (ECDSA).
Renamed `resend_id` → `provider_message_id` across `email_logs` and updated indexes.
Unified webhook endpoint to `/webhooks/email` with generic middleware/job.
Restored legacy SDK compatibility while centralizing config under `services.email_webhook`.

## [2026-04-05] init | Wiki created from CLAUDE.md seed
Scaffolded wiki structure. Created SCHEMA.md, index.md, log.md, and 9 seed pages
derived from CLAUDE.md: overview, architecture, services, vault-pipeline, permissions,
frontend, database, middleware, ai-hub, testing.

## [2026-04-05] update | Resend email integration implemented
Created [modules/email](modules/email.md): full documentation of the listener pipeline
(StopSuppressedEmail → InjectUnsubscribeHeaders → LogSentEmail), webhook
verification, suppression model, unsubscribe flow, stats caching, and
EmailLogPolicy registration. Updated [database/collections](database/collections.md) with email_logs
and suppressed_emails. Updated [architecture/middleware](architecture/middleware.md) with resend.webhook
alias and event auto-discovery note (withEvents discover:false).

## [2026-04-05] ingest | Resend.com mail integration brainstorm
Digested `docs/brainstorm-resend-integration.md`. Key decisions captured: credentials
in `.env` only (RESEND_KEY, RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET), MongoDB TTL 90d (EMAIL_LOG_TTL_DAYS),
webhook handler queued as ProcessResendWebhook job (updateOrCreate race-safety), CTR as
primary AI signal, HMAC-signed unsubscribe tokens, List-Unsubscribe header required.
New wiki page to create: [modules/email](modules/email.md) once implementation begins.
